# postEvent

This function is used primarilly by [JournalLimpet](https://journal-limpet "Journal Limpet") and [EDMC-Canonn[(https://canonn.fyi/plugin "Canonn EDMC Plugin")] to submit events to the Canonn Database. 

It is designed to accept batches of events so that they can be bulk inserted. 

# Usage

If you wish to submit data to canonn you must first lookup the whitelist to see which events to send so as to spare our precious bandwidth.
